Use 'npm install' on root directory then cd into spa-metaweather-test directory and 'npm install' again

Then 'npm start' on root directory in order to get the metaweather service. (calling the endpoint from the client gets blocked by cors).

Open a new terminal on the spa-metaweather-test directory and type 'npm run serve' to run the app.
